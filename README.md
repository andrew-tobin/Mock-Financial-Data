# Mock-Financial-Data
Python code to generate a mock financial dataset, primarily using pandas and faker libraries. The mock data covers an Investment Bank's client revenue figures. 

Generation covers two tables (connected on client ID):
* A financial fact table, with revenue/RWA data by client and year
* A client dimension table, with randomised industries, company sizes etc.

This data is used as input for a Tableau dashboard.
